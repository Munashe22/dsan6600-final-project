On the small island state of Barbados, cars, buses and taxis are the primary mode of transport, and traffic is a well-known problem that affects every Barbadian citizen. The Ministry of Transport and Works is trying to solve the problem with machine learning through an open competition.

Our task is to predict traffic congestion using machine learning, with the aim of recognising the root causes of traffic in a specific roundabout in Barbados. We have been provided with four streams of video data, labelled with the congestion rating for the entrance and exit timestamps, and our model predicts traffic congestion five minutes into the future. Ultimately, we are interested in identifying the root causes of increased time spent in the roundabout by developing features from unstructured video data. 

Back-propagation is not allowed in training or inference. (tbd)

The model will potentially help the Ministry of Transport and Works predict traffic flow and identify and address root causes of traffic in roundabouts. They will use this information to design interventions to reduce traffic across the island, improving the lives of every citizen.
